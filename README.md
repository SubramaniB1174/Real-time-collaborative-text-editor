Document Management: Create, update, and delete personal documents.

Real-Time Collaboration: Edits and cursor movements are synchronized instantly across connected users using WebSockets.

Editor Integration: Rich text editing capabilities using tools like Quill.js.

Live Presence: See who else is viewing or editing a document in real time.

MongoDB Integration: Persistent storage of documents and user data.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: React, Quill.js, Socket.IO-client

Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO, MongoDB

Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

Database: MongoDB
